Friend Shared Playlist Function - Complete Fix (Rev 00078)

## Summary

### Root Cause
- script type="module" was executing in ES6 module scope
- window.viewFriendPlaylistTracks assignment inside module did not expose function to global scope
- onclick="window.viewFriendPlaylistTracks(...)" on playlist cards failed because function was undefined

### Fix Applied
**File**: templates/index.html
**Line**: 3559

**Before**: script type="module"
**After**: script (removed type attribute)

### Verification Results
After Rev 00078 deployment, all friend-related functions are now available in global scope:
- window.loadFriendsData -> function
- window.acceptFriendRequest -> function
- window.viewFriendProfile -> function
- window.viewFriendPlaylists -> function
- window.viewFriendPlaylistTracks -> function

**Test**: typeof window.viewFriendPlaylistTracks
**Result**: 'function' (was 'undefined' before fix)

## Deployment Info
- Revision: yt-transcript-00078-5gx
- Deploy Time: 2025-10-03 08:58 UTC
- Production URL: https://yt-transcript-ycqe3vmjva-an.a.run.app
- Region: asia-northeast1

## Testing Completed
1. Friend screen access: OK
2. Friend playlist screen display: OK (appears in front of sidebar)
3. Playlist card onclick attribute: OK (correctly set)
4. Global function availability: OK (all functions available)

## Technical Details
### ES6 Module Scope Issue
- script tags with type="module" execute in isolated module scope
- Variables and functions in modules are not exposed to global scope by default
- window.xxx = yyy assignments may not work as expected in module scope

### Solution
- Removed type="module" attribute to run as normal script
- This allows window.viewFriendPlaylistTracks = viewFriendPlaylistTracks to correctly expose function globally

## User Impact
Users can now:
1. Click "Playlists (1)" button from friend list
2. See friend's shared playlist screen
3. Click playlist cards (e.g., MUSIC)
4. View track list in the playlist
5. Play tracks

## Changes from Previous Session
- Rev 00077: Added window. prefix to onclick attribute (no effect)
- Rev 00078: Removed type="module" from script tag (root cause fixed)

Fix completed. Users can now access friend shared playlists normally.
